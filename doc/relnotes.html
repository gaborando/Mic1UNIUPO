<H3>To Do (proposed for the <EM>next</EM> version release)</H3>
<P>
Note: A number of the following have been completed in some form
or another.  We're still in the process of reviewing each
item before we check them off this list.
<P>

<OL>
<LI>
Change ijvmasm to allow numeric arguments to ILOAD and ISTORE,
not just variable names declared between ".var" and ".end-var".
This would require some significant changes to the assembler, 
but would be more in keeping with Jasmine.  The ".var" directive
of Jasmine allows you to associate a name with a variable number,
but all IINC, ILOAD and ISTORE instructions would still reference the
number (not the name).  
<P>
Another complication is that the 
assembler would need to scan for the maximum variable number of
all IINC, ILOAD, and ISTORE instructions and consider the number
of parameters passed, rather than simply count the number of 
parameters and variables given.  The current approach requires
that all local variables and parameters get symbolic names.
<P>

<LI>
Eliminate "spasticness" in the startup of the simulator.
<P>

<LI>
Fix echo.jas to correct non-print-characters being echoed as space.
<P>

<LI>
Document add.jas in the user guide to explain how it works.
<P>

<LI>
Document echo.jas in the user guide to explain how it works.
<P>

<LI>
Modify add.jas to give a message each time through the loop, 
like  "Please type two numbers, each terminated by ENTER."
Also, output a blank line before that message again.
<P>

<LI>
Eliminate manual page files by combining this information into 
primary documentation.
<P>

<LI>
Explain how to set CLASSPATH on various platforms, and what to
do if you already have one.
<P>

<LI>
The IJVM Assembly Language Specification is perhaps misnamed.
This includes some specific information about the assembler
(e.g., ijvm.conf).   We should consider renaming this and the
MAL Micro-assemply Language Specification.
<P>

<LI>
Allow a BELL character to be sent to standard output
<P>

<LI>
Create mailing list.

<LI>
Some of the material in the faq.html duplicate material in the
other manuals.  Shorten it by not including things described elsewhere.
For example, you might have a question "How do I do I/O?"  With answer:
"Use the IN and OUT instructions.  These are discussed in Section 7
of jas.html." and then move the full discussion there.
<P>

</OL>

<H3>To Do (proposed for some future release)</H3>
<P>

<OL>
<LI>
Modify mic1sim to allow memory in the neighborhood of SP, PC, MAR, LV, CPP 
(or elsewhere) to be displayed, or even modified.
<I>
This is mostly just a matter of deciding how to make this intuitive and
attractive, and then writing the code.  
</I>
<B>
If you have suggestions about
what it should look like on the screen, or what buttons/menu items/etc
should be used, send a note to

Dan Stone (<A HREF="mailto:dans@ontko.com">dans@ontko.com</A>).
<P>

<LI>
Rework the Windows install to use an appropriate Windows-style 
install program.  
<I>
Casual users may be better served by having a 
familiar interface to find the java executable, set up the class
path, etc.  
</I>
<B>
We will gladly accept help from anyone who is familiar
with Windows install tools and setting up Java applications under
Windows 95/98/NT.
</B>
<P>

<LI>
Create a distribution for Macintosh.  
<I>
Now that Apple has a stable
version of the JDK available, it should be reasonable to provide
a distribution.  Now all we have to do is figure out how to do 
binhex or whatever to do an install there.  
</I>
<B>
We will gladly
accept help from anyone who knows the Mac environment well
and understands the issues of installing and running Java 
software on a the Mac.
</B>
<P>

<LI>
Support multiple documentation file formats: html, ps, ascii, etc.
<I>
Our plan here is to convert the existing files to SGML, and then
generate an appropriate collection of printable, browsable, viewable
documents from a single source.  
</I>
<B>
We will gladly accept help
from anyone who knows SGML to get us started down this path.
</B>
<P>

<LI>
Set up bug tracking system: gnats vs. debian bug reporting system.
<B>
If you have experience with either of these systems (or any other
free bug tracking system) and have an opinion about its suitability
for the mic1 project, please send a note to
